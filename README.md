# ðŸš— Auto Insurance Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent insurance claims using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a robust classification model that can help an insurance company flag suspicious claims for further investigation.

We followed a full ML pipeline including data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and final deployment.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

Three datasets were used:
1. **Train Dataset** â€“ Used to train the models.
2. **Validation Dataset** â€“ Used to validate and tune model performance.
3. **Test Dataset** â€“ Used to evaluate the final selected model.

The target variable is: **`Fraud_Ind`**  
- `Y` â†’ Fraudulent Claim  
- `N` â†’ Legitimate Claim

## ðŸ”§ Project Workflow

### 1. ðŸ“¥ Data Loading
- Loaded training, validation, and test datasets using Pandas.

### 2. ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values.
- Removed duplicate rows.
- Treated outliers (if any).

### 3. ðŸ”„ Feature Engineering
Created new features to enhance model performance:
- `Claim_Duration_Days`
- `Claim_Amount_per_Injury`
- `Is_Weekend_Accident`
- `Police_Contacted_Flag`
- `Total_Damage_Score`

Also performed:
- Label encoding of categorical variables.
- Date parsing for duration features.

### 4. ðŸ“Š Feature Scaling
- Applied **StandardScaler** to numerical columns.

### 5. ðŸ¤– Model Training
Trained and evaluated 10+ classification models.  
The best performing model was selected based on validation metrics.

âœ… **Selected Model**: `RandomForestClassifier`

### 6. ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation
Evaluated the final model on the **test set** using:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- Precision-Recall Curve
- AUC Score

### 7. ðŸ“ˆ KPI Visualization
Plotted:
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- Precision-Recall Curve
- Classification Report

## ðŸ§  Final Model Details

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
